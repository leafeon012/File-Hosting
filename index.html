    <p>Encodes(Cloaks) your binary files into base64 text files and then can decode
    them back to their binary versions.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>Many enterprise email setups don't allow sending of binary files. You can now
    encode it to a base64 file send it via email and then decode it back on the
    destination.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Does my file get uploaded to a server?
      No, all of the encoding/decoding happens on your computer. The javascript
      itself is pretty straightforward, you can dig into it and see what is going on.
      If you still don't trust me, unplug your network cable while encoding/decoding :)</li>
    </ol>
